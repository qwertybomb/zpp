# ZPP
A work in progress C preprocessor written in standard C99 with no external libraries required.

## Main features missing.
* char literals in `#if`.
* `#pragma once`

## Building.
To build it you must first run `vcvarsall.bat` and then run `nmake`.
For now building only works with MSVC on Windows however it could likely build elsewhere with a few changes.
